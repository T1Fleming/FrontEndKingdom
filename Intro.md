# This is it

## Strategy

I dislike rote note taking when trying to learn something new. Personally I feel other approaches have worked better for me.

Note taking is necessary to a degree, but my all time favorite approach has always been to form questions and answers. This is the approach you'll see me favor in this repository.

Therefore... treat this experience as more of a problem sheet and example approach ðŸ˜‰ (otherwise this might not be the place for you)

A summary of how I prioritize my approach

1) Examples / Questions / Answers
2) Cheatsheets
3) Infographics / Visual Representaions / Maps
4) Notes
